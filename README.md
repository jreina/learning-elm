# learning-elm

## what is this?

The source I ended up with after going through the
[_Start Using Elm to Build Web Applications tutorial on egghead.io_](https://egghead.io/courses/start-using-elm-to-build-web-applications).

Super basic Elm concepts and language features.

## how to run

1. `npm install -g elm`
1. `elm reactor`
